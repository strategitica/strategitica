// Bootstrap applied overflow: hidden to .progress-bar because of this issue:
// https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/29622 Maybe this fix satisfies some
// people, but for me it causes an issue: When .progress-bar is small (i.e.
// whatever it's showing is a low percentage of a whole), with overflow:
// hidden, the text inside .progress-bar (which, in Strategitica, shows
// [current amount] / [maximum amount] for health, experience and mana) gets
// cut off. I don't want it to get cut off just because .progress-bar is
// small--I want people to see exactly how much they have of whatever resource
// it is. Anyway, the issue in that Github link applies to IE. Microsoft's
// support for IE is going away, and therefore I see no reason to support it
// anymore myself. So, I'm reversing this change here.
