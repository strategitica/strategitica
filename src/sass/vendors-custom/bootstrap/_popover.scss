// I've tried getting habitica-markdown to render markdown text after a popover
// is opened, but either I'm having a hard time or it's just not possible, I'm
// not sure which. So instead, I have to do the habitica-markdown rendering
// when the popover contents for each task is created, before any of them are
// opened. This seems to work ok, but the popover title is a different story.
// Typically, the title is added via the title HTML attribute, or as part of a
// popover options object. In either case, it'd basically mean putting the task
// title in an HTML attribute. This hasn't been a problem in the past, but
// doing habitica-markdown rendering on the title and then putting it into an
// HTML attribute seems to cause problems. So instead, I'm changing the popover
// template to forget about the title, and I'm putting .popover-header (which
// is what the title would go in) in .popover-body instead of outside of it,
// and doing the habitica-markdown rendering on the title in the same place as
// the rest of the popover contents. Phew, that was a long explanation!

.popover-body .popover-header {
    margin-top: -$popover-body-padding-y;
    margin-right: -$popover-body-padding-x;
    margin-left: -$popover-body-padding-x;
}
